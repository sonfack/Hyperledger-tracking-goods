# Hyperledger-tracking-goods
This projet is to build a tracking system base on Hyperledger Fabric. 
How it works : 
- The user buys a product from a shop on the system,
- The invoice issued by the shop to the user is register on Hyperledger 
- If the user decide to sale the product he baught to another user, the system will keep track of the saleDocument,
- For any sale from user to user there is a new saleDocument provide and stored in the system.
This list of saleDocument will be used to track the product and the users.
